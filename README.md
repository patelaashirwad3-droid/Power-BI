# End-To-End Sales Analysis
# Sales & Product Analysis Dashboard
## Project Description
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and product performance over a 3-year period using 8,399 rows of transactional data. The report was developed using Power BI and designed with a snowflake schema data model, integrating multiple dimension tables with the central fact table for accurate and efficient reporting.
The dashboard enables stakeholders to track key business KPIs, identify top-performing products and customers, analyze regional performance, and monitor sales growth trends. It offers actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions related to product categories, sales channels, and customer engagement.
